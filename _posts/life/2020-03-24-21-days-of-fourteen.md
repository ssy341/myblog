## Thinking before meals

- 1,have a try to describe what you want to do today in English.
    
    The most important thing that I want to do is make a lot of money. I almost have this thought every day. Even though it is not true. But I have try to dream.


- 2,when you speak English，what is the biggest difficulty?
    
    Don't know how to say to show ideas or thought.


## Fucking the things

- 1,Today, in the group, we have to use English to finish our work, including punching and communication.


- 2,Today, let's discuss some interesting topics in English:
    
    (1)Have you found any lovely and beautiful points in your life? What do you like to do? For example, walking and cooking. Try to know life objectively and enjoy life.

        Meeting some new friends is a beautiful thing. And make progress every day with all of you. 


    (2)Do you realize that the world is not black or white? There is nothing really good or bad, the definition is all artificial. So, how do you get along with the world in the future?

        Let it be, and let it go.
